## Integration with Existing OCRInvoice Codebase

### Critical Integration Requirements

The GUI must integrate seamlessly with the existing `ocrinvoice` CLI application. This integration is **mandatory** and affects all development phases.

#### Existing Codebase Structure
```
src/ocrinvoice/
├── cli/                    # Existing CLI interface
├── business/               # Business logic (aliases, validation)
├── parsers/                # OCR parsing logic
├── utils/                  # Shared utilities
└── gui/                    # NEW: GUI components (to be developed)
```

#### Integration Points

1. **Business Logic Integration**
   - Use existing `business/` modules for alias management
   - Leverage existing validation logic from `parsers/`
   - Share configuration with CLI components
   - Maintain data format compatibility

2. **OCR Processing Integration**
   - Import and use existing OCR parsing functions from `parsers/`
   - Reuse confidence scoring algorithms
   - Maintain same field extraction logic
   - Use existing error handling patterns

3. **Data Format Compatibility**
   - GUI must read/write same JSON formats as CLI
   - Maintain compatibility with existing alias files
   - Use same configuration file formats
   - Ensure CLI and GUI can share the same data directory

4. **Configuration Sharing**
   - GUI should read existing CLI configuration

2. **Workflow Compatibility Tests**
   - User can start with CLI, continue with GUI
   - User can start with GUI, continue with CLI
   - Batch operations work across both interfaces
   - Settings are consistent between interfaces

3. **Error Handling Compatibility**
   - GUI handles same error conditions as CLI
   - Error messages are consistent
   - Recovery procedures work in both interfaces
