## üîß Code Contributions

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork of the project
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: Create a branch for your changes
3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or fix
4. **Write Tests**: Add tests for your changes
5. **Run Quality Checks**: Ensure code meets quality standards
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a PR with your changes

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/description-of-feature` - For new features
- `fix/description-of-bug` - For bug fixes
- `docs/description-of-docs` - For documentation changes
- `test/description-of-tests` - For test improvements
- `refactor/description-of-refactor` - For code refactoring

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat: add support for credit card statement parsing
fix: resolve OCR error correction for amount extraction
docs: update CLI reference with new commands
test: add unit tests for fuzzy matching algorithm
```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### Python Code Style

- **Follow PEP 8**: Use Black for code formatting
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black default)

#### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union
from pathlib import Path


def process_invoice(
    pdf_path: Union[str, Path],
    config: Optional[Dict[str, any]] = None
) -> Dict[str, any]:
    """Process an invoice PDF and extract structured data.

    Args:
        pdf_path: Path to the PDF file to process
        config: Optional configuration dictionary

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing extracted invoice data

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the PDF file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If the PDF file is invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Coverage

- **Minimum Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ test coverage
- **New Features**: All new features must have tests
- **Bug Fixes**: Bug fixes must include regression tests
- **Integration Tests**: Include integration tests for complex features

#### Test Structure

```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path
from ocrinvoice.parsers.invoice_parser import InvoiceParser


class TestInvoiceParser:
    """Test cases for InvoiceParser class."""

    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.parser = InvoiceParser()
        self.test_file = Path("tests/fixtures/sample_invoice.pdf")

    def test_parse_invoice_success(self):
        """Test successful invoice parsing."""
        result = self.parser.parse(self.test_file)

        assert result["success"] is True
        assert "company" in result
        assert "total" in result
        assert "date" in result

    def test_parse_invoice_file_not_found(self):
        """Test parsing with non-existent file."""
        with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
            self.parser.parse("non_existent_file.pdf")
```

### Quality Checks

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all quality checks:

```bash
# Run all quality checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Or run individual checks
black src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/
pytest --cov=src/ocrinvoice
```
